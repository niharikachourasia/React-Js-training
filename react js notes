react js is used for building reusable UI components.
it is a java script library.
react uses virtual dom.
regular dom: dom is a document object model. everything in dom is treated as a node.
element is treated as a node.
virtual dom: whenevr we change the state of your application, the virtual dom changnode -v
node -v


when we want to declare varibal;e in es6, then we use let or const
create a folder; 


2 types of export:
named and default

with named: there is a restriction, that whenever we use named export, 
 same name should be used while importing

for example:
with default export:
let k; export defualt k =12; //test.js

now while importing:
import m from'./test'
console.log(m)


with named export:
export k=12 //test.js

now while importing:
import {k} from './test'



person.js
const person={
name:'max'
}
export default person


utility.js
export const clean=()=>{}
export const baseData=10


app.js

import person from './person.js' //default export
import prs from ./person.js' //default export

import {baseDta} from './utility.js' //named export
import {clean} from './utility.js'//named export
